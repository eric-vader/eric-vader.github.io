## Modules Taught over the years

Module description taken from CORS.

1. **CS3203 - Software Engineering Project (8MC)** This module provides students with hands-on experience in working in project groups through a complete SDLC to develop a well-designed, well-tested, large-scaled software system. The students will apply the current best software engineering practices on the analysis, design, implementation, and testing of software system. Through the project, students will practise analysis of user’s needs, formulation of computing requirements to meet the user’s needs, modelling and design of the computer systems according to the requirements, evaluation of the design, efficient implementation of software components, system integration, software version control, and rigorous testing.
