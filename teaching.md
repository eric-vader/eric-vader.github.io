# Teaching Philosophy

My philosophy of education is that students who are inquisitive and curious about the subject are effective learners. I believe effective learning is primarily driven by an innate desire to learn the subject rather than a need to learn (secondary). Hence, I am very focused on creating an environment that fosters each student's desire to learn. Specifically, I believe three elements foster a learning-positive environment: (1) Creating a relaxed and safe environment. (2) Engaging students to facilitate learning in and after class. (3) Creating equal opportunities for all students to learn.

## Teaching Feedback

> The best TA i have ever met in my 3 years in NUS. He go above and beyond what is expected of him by the students. He is concern about our wellbeing and often encourage us to do better.

> Eric keeps the sessions informal and casual, an environment where the best learning takes place in my opinion. By keeping the
knowledge–sharing lighthearted, he is able to retain the attention of students well while keeping it entertaining and engaging. Very
few TAs have been able to do that in my experience and it makes him stand apart as an educator.

> What sets Eric apart is not just his expertise, but his genuine enthusiasm for teaching and his dedication to his students' learning. He consistently goes beyond the traditional lecture format, incorporating real–world examples and hands–on projects that enhance learning outcomes and keep the class intriguing and relevant. His patience and willingness to answer questions, provide feedback, and offer encouragement have created a supportive and stimulating learning environment.
