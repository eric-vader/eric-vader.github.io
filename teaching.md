# Teaching Philosophy

My philosophy of education is that students who are inquisitive and curious about the subject are effective learners. I believe effective learning is primarily driven by an innate desire to learn the subject rather than a need to learn (secondary). Hence, I am very focused on creating an environment that fosters each student's desire to learn. Specifically, I believe three elements foster a learning-positive environment: (1) Creating a relaxed and safe environment. (2) Engaging students to facilitate learning in and after class. (3) Creating equal opportunities for all students to learn.

> Eric is a very caring tutor who is always looking out for us and consistently motivate us to excel further. Not only is he very approach, he also teaches very effectively. I was able to learn effectively through his patient and sophisticated guidance. I feel that I could not ask for a better tutor.

> Excellent tutor. Goes out of his way to help students. Incredibly easy to approach.
> <p style="text-align: right">- Student from AY2021/22 S2</p>

> Eric keeps the sessions informal and casual, an environment where the best learning takes place in my opinion. By keeping the
knowledgeâ€“sharing lighthearted, he is able to retain the attention of students well while keeping it entertaining and engaging. Very
few TAs have been able to do that in my experience and it makes him stand apart as an educator.
